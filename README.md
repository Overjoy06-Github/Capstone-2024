# **Smart Aquaponics System Capstone Project**

## Project Overview:

The Smart Aquaponics System is a capstone project designed to integrate IoT (Internet of Things) sensors for monitoring crucial parameters like pH levels and temperature in an aquaponics setup. The system aims to provide real-time data insights to enhance the efficiency and productivity of aquaponics farming.

## Setup and Execution Instructions:
1. Open iot-sensors.ino in the Arduino IDE.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
3. Execute startup.bat
4. Access the Smart Aquaponics System through website.html
5. Monitor pH levels and temperature in real-time for optimized aquaponics farming.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the Smart Aquaponics System capstone project, along with instructions for setup and execution. It serves as a guide for users and potential collaborators interested in understanding and contributing to the project.
